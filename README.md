# USCyberGames2024
A repo for the USCyberGames and the challenges i was able to get to. I was able to participate for around 3 days here and there but my university started classes again on the monday of the the US open so was not able to participate the full term. I was able to score 450 points I feel I was pretty close to a few more and even found one that had correct flag formating and everything but it would not accept it. It was a funn time and i enjoyed being able to solve(and trying to solve) the challenges. 

The most exciting one in particular challenge(Pipeline_problems) i was able to find a private repo that housed a dockerfile and script to automate a docker container that was supposed to spit out the flag. I was not able to achieve the part where the docker would spit out the flag even after i changed my network address to be within the subnet 10.0.0.0/24 per the src directories readme.md conditional.
